[Urbit](https://urbit.org) is a personal server stack built from scratch. It
has an identity layer (Azimuth), virtual machine (Vere), and operating system
(Arvo).

A running Urbit "ship" is designed to operate with other ships peer-to-peer.
Urbit is a general-purpose, peer-to-peer computer and network.

This repository contains:

- The [Arvo OS][arvo]
- [herb][herb], a tool for Unix control of an Urbit ship
- Source code for [Landscape's web interface][land
- Source code for the [vere][vere] virtual machine.

For more on the identity layer, see [Azimuth][azim]. To manage your Urbit
identity, use [Bridge][brid].

## Development

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/urbit/urbit.svg?branch=master)][trav]

Urbit uses [Nix][nix] to manage builds.  On Linux and macOS you can install Nix
via:

```
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```

The Makefile in the project's root directory contains useful phony targets for
building, installing, testing, and so on.  You can use it to avoid dealing with
Nix explicitly.

To build the Urbit virtual machine binary, for example, use:

```
make build
```

The test suite can similarly be run via a simple:

```
make test
```

Note that some of the Makefile targets need access to pills tracked via [git
LFS][git-lfs], so you'll also need to have those available locally:

```
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

Usage:

  |fuse %destination-desk base-beak ~[[source-beak %some-germ] [another-beak %another-germ]]

A fuse replaces the contents of %destination-desk with the merge of the
specified beaks according to their merge strategies. This has no dependence
on the previous state of %destination-desk so any commits/work there will
be overwritten.
